# Mao
A card game where you figure out the rules as you go.

## Rules
- Game starts with "Commence".
- Players are dealt 7 cards each.
- Players may play any card from their hand that is of the same suit or same value as top card in `used_pile`.
- If a player has no playable card, they must draw from the deck
- Player receives a card for breaking a rule - that player must say “thank you”
- If player doesn't say what they are supposed to say, then game says "Failure to say {\_}." That is also a penalty, and they would be given a card.
  - Probably have the system wait for 5 seconds before saying "Failure to say {\_}.
- If player says something they can say in another situation, but they do it in the wrong situtation, game says, "Incorrect use of {\_}."
- If player plays a 7, they must say "Have a nice day." If they don't, the game says "Failure to say 'Have a nice day.'" and would penalize them.
- For each additional 7 played on top of the base 7, the next player must add a “very” before the “nice”.
  - For example, if it is the fourth 7 played, the player who placed that 7 must say “have a very, very, very nice day
  - Whoever breaks the chain or says it wrong would get a penalty equal to number of "very"s.
- If a player plays a spade, they need to say card value + "of spades."
  - For example, playing an ace of spades would require them to say "Ace of Spades."
- Playing an Ace skips the next player
- Playing a 2 allows you to go again
- Playing an 8 flips the direction of play
- If someone has 1 card, they have to say "Mao." If they don't, the system penalizes them with "Failure to say 'Mao.'" and gives them one card.
- The aim of the game is to get rid of all of your cards.
- Whoever wins a round can add or remove a rule for the next round.
